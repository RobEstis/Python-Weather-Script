# Python-Weather-Script
A simple Python Weather Script

This script uses the requests library to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This script fetches the current weather data for the specified city and prints the temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and a brief weather description. The Script also measures the response time from the API.

Replace "KEY" with your actual API Key from OpenWeatherMap.
Replace "CITY" with your current city.
